# SpinalHDL Re-Implementation of Verilog Baseline Project

This repository contains a re-implementation of a baseline Verilog hardware design using [SpinalHDL](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL) â€” a high-level hardware description language built on Scala.  
The project demonstrates how complex or low-level Verilog logic can be restructured using SpinalHDL to improve maintainability, readability, and productivity.
