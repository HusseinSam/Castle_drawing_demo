# Silice Re-Implementation of Verilog Baseline Project

This repository contains a re-implementation of a baseline Verilog hardware design using [Silice](https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice) â€” a C-like HDL aimed at readability and synthesis-friendly structures.  
The goal of this project is to showcase the benefits of Silice for hardware development, alongside the original Verilog implementation for reference and comparison.
